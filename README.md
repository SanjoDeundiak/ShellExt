<h1>Overview</h1>

This is Windows Shell Context Menu Extension COM component 
that allows users to get some log-file with important information:
date, size and a perÂ­byte sum (a flavour of checksum, 4 bytes for
each file).

In this extension I have implemented thread pool using boost 
concurrency for finding check-sum. It is ready to work with huge 
amount of files.

Part of code related to COM is from Microsoft's example:

But there were several minor bugs in this example, that I had fixed.
